 ## Milestone 1-3: data cleaning

 The files clean_image_data and clean_tabular data contain code to clean the marketplace data. 

 In the case of the tabular data, the code loads the data into a dataframe, removes the Â£ sign from the price column, and re-casts the series as float data. The resulting modified dataframe is then saved to a new .csv file.
